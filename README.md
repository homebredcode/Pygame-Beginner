# Pygame-Beginner
This is a "code-along", following most of the steps from Tech with Tim, coding a simple 2D Game : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY&amp;ab_channel=TechWithTim

My goal for this project is to learn more python and try to internalize previous concepts i have learned to get a more intuitive grasp on as many concepts as possible.

Any changes and/or features i add seperate from Tim will be documented below.
